The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of The NoteHelper website.

| Requirement ID | Description             | User Story                                                                                                                                                                | Expected Behavior / Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FR001**      | Create a Territory       | As a user, I want to be able to create a territory to later assign to customers and sellers.                                                                              | The system should provide a way for the user to initiate the creation of a new territory, presenting a list of existing territories to prevent duplicates from being created. A territory does not have to have a seller associated with it but can have multiple sellers associated with it.                                                                                                                                                |
| **FR002**      | Create a Seller          | As a user, I want to be able to create a Seller that can be assigned a territory and later be assigned to a customer.                                                     | The system should provide a way for the user to initiate the creation of a new seller. It should provide a way to assign an existing territory or create a new one if needed. It should show all existing sellers to prevent duplication.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **FR003**      | Create a Customer        | As a user, I want to be able to create a Customer that can be assigned a seller and territory, with a TPID and optional URL.                                              | The system should provide a way to initiate the creation of a customer with a numerical TPID (Top Parent ID) field. It should allow assigning an existing territory and seller but not require this. If a seller is selected that is already assigned a territory, automatically pick that territory. A customer can exist without a territory or seller. The user can optionally provide a URL that the TPID will link to when displayed. |
| **FR004**      | Create a Topic           | As a user, I want to be able to create topics that I can then tag my calls with so I can search by tag later.                                                             | The system should provide a way for the user to initiate the creation of a Topic. It should show all other topics available to prevent duplication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **FR005**      | Create a Call Log        | As a user, I want to be able to create a call log that I can assign to a customer and tag with Topics. I want this to be rich text and be able to paste screenshots.      | The system should provide a clear way to create a Call Log. Customer selection is required. The seller field is automatically populated from the selected customer and displayed as read-only (users cannot change the seller independently of the customer). The system allows adding multiple topics and inline creation of new topics. It includes a rich text editor for call details with screenshot pasting. It auto-chooses the current date/time but allows overrides. The read-only seller field has appropriate styling for both light and dark modes. |
| **FR006**      | View/Edit a Territory    | As a user, I want to pick one of my territories to view and see accounts and recent calls, and toggle an edit view to update its name.                                    | The system should allow viewing a specific territory, its details, related sellers, and calls in the last week. It should allow editing the territory name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **FR007**      | View/Edit a Seller       | As a user, I want to see my sellers and make changes to them as needed.                                                                                                    | The system should allow viewing specific sellers and editing their name and territory. It should list all their customers and the date of the most recent call for each, sorted by most recent. A seller can have multiple customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **FR008**      | View/Edit a Customer     | As a user, I want to view a single customer, edit their name, TPID, TPID URL, seller, and territory if needed, and see all calls for them.                               | The system should allow viewing specific customers, editing their name, TPID, optional TPID URL, seller, and territory, and listing all call logs for that customer with dates, sorted by most recent first. When displaying the customer name, the TPID should be shown in parentheses and be clickable (linking to the TPID URL) if a URL has been configured.                                                                          |
| **FR009**      | View/Edit Topics         | As a user, I want to be able to view all available topics and edit any as needed.                                                                                          | The system should allow viewing all topics and editing their names and descriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **FR010**      | View/Edit a Call Log     | As a user, I want to be able to view specific call logs and make changes as needed.                                                                                        | The system should allow viewing specific call logs and updating their topics, contents, or seller if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **FR011**      | View notes that match a filter | As a user, I want to view my call logs in any filterable way. I want to view per customer, per territory, by topics, grouped with most recent calls first.          | The system should provide a way to view call logs with filters. Logs should be grouped by customer (ordered by most recent call), then those customers grouped by seller. The grouping structure is: Seller → Customers (sorted by most recent call) → Calls (sorted by date). It should allow free-text search. It should allow filtering by customer, seller, territory, or any topics.                                                      |
| **FR012**      | Navigation & List Views    | As a user, I want to navigate to view all my territories, sellers, and customers.                                                                                     | The system should provide a navigation menu allowing users to view lists of all their territories, sellers, and customers. Each list view should allow clicking into individual items to view details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **FR013**      | Single User System | As a user, I want this to be a single-user application without authentication requirements.                                                                    | The system is designed for single-user deployment without authentication. Each instance of the application is for one user only. If teammates want to use this application, they should deploy their own instance. No user management or authentication system is required.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **FR014**      | Data Validation Requirements | As a user, I want appropriate validation on required fields when creating entities.                                                                                  | Territory name is required when creating a territory. Seller name is required when creating a seller. Customer name and TPID are required when creating a customer. TPID must be numeric. TPID URL is optional. Topic name is required when creating a topic. Call logs must have content, customer, and date. Topics have names by default but can optionally have descriptions added when editing the topic.                            |
| **FR015**      | Entity Deletion             | As a user, I do not need the ability to delete entities in this initial phase.                                                                                         | The system should not implement deletion functionality for territories, sellers, customers, topics, or call logs in this phase. This functionality may be added in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **FR016**      | Timezone-Aware Timestamps   | As a user, I want created/updated timestamps to display in my browser's local timezone, not UTC.                                                                      | The system should store all datetime values in the database with timezone information (UTC). When displaying created_at and updated_at timestamps in the UI, JavaScript should automatically convert them to the user's local browser timezone. The database uses TIMESTAMPTZ columns and Python uses timezone-aware datetime objects.                                                                                                    |
| **FR017**      | Create Entity Workflow      | As a user, after creating a seller or territory, I want to return to the list page to immediately create another if needed.                                           | When creating a new seller or territory, after successful creation, the system should redirect to the respective list page (sellers or territories) rather than the detail view page. This allows users to see their newly created entity in the list and quickly create additional entities without extra navigation. The success message will still confirm the creation.                                                                |
| **FR018**      | Call Logs Display Layout    | As a user, I want the call logs list to display cleanly with proper clickable areas for customer names, TPIDs, and call content.                                      | The call logs list should display with the call content as the primary clickable link to view details. Customer names should link to customer detail pages, TPIDs should link to external URLs if configured. No nested anchor tags should be used. The layout should show customer name and TPID on one line with the date on the right, followed by call content preview, then badges for seller, territory, and topics.              |
| **FR019**      | Customers List Display Layout | As a user, I want the customers list to display cleanly with proper clickable areas without nested links causing layout issues.                                      | The customers list should avoid nested anchor tags. Customer names should be clickable links to their detail pages, TPIDs should link to external URLs if configured. The layout should show customer name and TPID on one line with call count on the right, followed by badges for seller and territory. No empty clickable areas should appear.                                                                                     |
| **FR020**      | Auto-populate Seller from Customer | As a user, when I create a new call log from a customer page, I want the seller field to be automatically populated if that customer has a seller assigned.       | When navigating to create a new call log with a pre-selected customer (via query parameter), the system should check if that customer has an assigned seller. If so, automatically pre-select that seller in the seller dropdown. This reduces data entry and ensures consistency between customer-seller relationships.                                                                                                               |
| **FR021**      | New Customer from Seller Page      | As a user, when viewing a seller, I want a button to create a new customer for that seller with seller and territory pre-populated.                             | The seller detail page should have a "New Customer" button that redirects to the customer creation form with the seller pre-selected. If that seller has a territory assigned, automatically pre-populate the territory field as well. This streamlines creating customers for specific sellers.                                                                                                                                   |
| **FR022**      | Link to Most Recent Call           | As a user, on the seller page customer list, I want the most recent call timestamp to be a clickable link to that call log.                                     | In the seller detail page's customer table, the "Most Recent Call" column should display the call date/time as a clickable link that navigates directly to that call log's detail page. This provides quick access to the most recent interaction with each customer. Timestamp should display in browser's local timezone with format "Mon DD, YYYY HH:MM AM/PM".                                                                   |
| **FR023**      | Clickable Homepage Cards           | As a user, I want to click anywhere on the homepage statistic cards to navigate to the respective list pages.                                                   | The homepage statistics cards (Call Logs, Customers, Sellers, Topics) should be entirely clickable, not just the "View All" button. Clicking anywhere on the card should navigate to the respective list page. Cards should have hover effects to indicate they are clickable (slight elevation and shadow on hover).                                                                                                              |
| **FR024**      | Date-Only Display in Lists         | As a user, I want call log dates in list views to show only the date without time, but show full date and time when viewing the call log details.              | Call log dates should display as "Mon DD, YYYY" format in all list and summary views (homepage, call logs list, customer view, seller view, topic view, search results). Only the call log detail page should show the full timestamp with time "Month DD, YYYY at HH:MM AM/PM". This reduces visual clutter while keeping detailed timing available when needed.                                                               |
| **FR025**      | Timezone Indicators                | As a user, I want to know what timezone timestamps are being displayed in.                                                                                      | All created/updated timestamps should display the timezone abbreviation (e.g., "PST", "EST") after the time. The system should automatically detect the browser's timezone and display it. Timestamps are stored in UTC in the database and converted to the user's local timezone for display.                                                                                                                                  |
| **FR026**      | Noon Time Special Handling         | As a user, when a call log's time is set to noon (12:00 PM), I want only the date shown without the time.                                                       | If a call log's time is exactly 12:00 PM (noon), the system should display only the date without the time portion in the call log detail view. The label should also change from "Date & Time" to just "Date". This recognizes that noon is often used as a default placeholder time when the exact time isn't important, reducing unnecessary detail display.                                                                    |
| **FR027**      | Create Topics on the Fly           | As a user, when adding topics to a call log, if my search doesn't find any existing topics, I want to press Enter to create a new topic with that name.         | While creating or editing a call log, when typing in the topic search box, if there are no matching existing topics, pressing Enter should create a new topic with the entered name via an AJAX API call. The newly created topic should automatically be added to the call log being edited. This eliminates the need to navigate away to create topics separately and streamlines the call log creation workflow.                    |
| **FR028**      | Quick Call Log Creation from Lists | As a user, I want a "New Call Log" button next to each customer in the customers list and seller detail pages that pre-populates the call log form.            | The customers list page should display a "New Call Log" button next to each customer. The seller detail page's customer table should have a "New Call Log" button in each row. Clicking these buttons should navigate to the call log creation form with the customer pre-selected. If the customer has an assigned seller and territory, those should also be pre-populated automatically. This provides quick access to log new calls without manual navigation and data entry. |
| **FR029**      | Quick Customer Creation from Sellers List | As a user, I want a "New Customer" button next to each seller in the sellers list page that pre-populates the customer form with that seller and their territory. | The sellers list page should display a "New Customer" button next to each seller's customer count. Clicking this button should navigate to the customer creation form with the seller pre-selected. If that seller has a territory assigned, the territory should also be pre-populated automatically. This streamlines the workflow for creating customers assigned to specific sellers. |
| **FR030**      | Show Existing Customers When Creating New Customer | As a user, when creating a new customer and selecting a seller, I want to see a list of that seller's existing customers to prevent creating duplicates. | On the New Customer page, when a seller is selected, a sidebar should display on the right showing all existing customers assigned to that seller. Each customer should show their name, TPID, and be clickable to open in a new tab. If no seller is selected or the seller has no customers, show an informational message. This helps users avoid accidentally creating duplicate customer records. |
| **FR031**      | Return to Referrer After Customer Creation | As a user, after creating a new customer, I want to return to the page I came from. | After successfully creating a customer, redirect back to the referring page (sellers list, seller detail, or customers list). A success flash message provides confirmation that the customer was created. This maintains workflow continuity by keeping the user in their current context rather than navigating away to the newly created customer's detail page. |
| **FR032**      | Create Customer from Territory | As a user, I want to create a customer from the territories page with the territory pre-populated. | The territories list page should have a "New Customer" button for each territory. Clicking this button navigates to the customer creation form with the territory pre-selected. If that territory has only one seller assigned, automatically pre-select that seller as well. This provides another entry point for creating customers organized by territory. |
| **FR033**      | Group Customers by Seller | As a user, I want the customers list page to group customers by their assigned seller. | The customers list page should organize customers into groups by seller. Each group shows the seller name, territory (if assigned), and customer count as a header, followed by the list of customers for that seller. Customers without an assigned seller should be shown in a separate "No Seller Assigned" group at the bottom. Within each group, customers are sorted alphabetically. This provides better organization and context when viewing all customers. |
| **FR034**      | Many-to-Many Seller-Territory Relationship | As a user, I want sellers to be able to be assigned to multiple territories, just like call logs can have multiple topics. | Sellers can be assigned to zero or more territories through a many-to-many relationship. The seller creation and edit pages should provide a searchable territory multi-select picker with keyboard navigation (similar to topic selection in call logs). Territory badges should be displayed on seller list and detail pages. On the customer list page, when a customer is grouped under a seller, the customer's territory badge is hidden if the seller has only one territory assigned (eliminating redundant information), but shown if the seller has multiple territories or no seller is assigned. The database uses a `sellers_territories` association table with foreign keys to both sellers and territories. The old `territory_id` column on sellers is kept for backwards compatibility during transition. |
| **FR035**      | Return to Referrer After Call Log Creation | As a user, after creating a new call log, I want to return to the page I came from instead of viewing the newly created call log. | After successfully creating a call log, redirect back to the referring page (customer detail, seller detail, topic detail, call logs list, or homepage). A success flash message provides confirmation that the call log was created. This maintains workflow continuity by keeping the user in their current context rather than navigating to the new call log's detail page. The referrer is passed as a hidden form field and preserved across form validation errors. |
| **FR036**      | Delete Topics | As a user, I want to be able to delete topics that are no longer needed. | The topic detail page should have a "Delete Topic" button that removes the topic from the database. When a topic is deleted, it is automatically removed from all call logs that were tagged with it (via cascade delete on the many-to-many relationship). A confirmation modal warns the user about the number of call logs that will be affected. After deletion, the user is redirected to the topics list page with a success message. This allows cleanup of obsolete or duplicate topics. |
| **FR037**      | Topic Autocomplete Keyboard Navigation | As a user, when adding topics to a call log, I want to use Tab key to select a suggested topic and Enter key to create a new topic. | While creating or editing a call log, when typing in the topic search box, arrow keys navigate through the autocomplete dropdown suggestions. Pressing Tab selects the currently highlighted suggestion and adds it to the call log. Pressing Enter when there are no suggestions creates a new topic with the entered name. Mouse clicks on dropdown items also work for selection. This provides intuitive keyboard navigation that aligns with standard form behavior (Tab to accept suggestions, Enter to submit). |
| **FR038**      | Customer Page Title Layout | As a user, when viewing customers with long names, I want the customer name, TPID, and action buttons to stay on one line with proper text truncation. | The customer detail page header uses a flexbox layout that keeps the customer name (with truncation), TPID, and action buttons (Edit, New Call Log) on a single line. Long customer names are truncated with ellipsis, and hovering shows a tooltip with the full name. The TPID never wraps and the action buttons never move to a second line. This ensures a clean, consistent layout regardless of customer name length. |
| **FR039**      | Dark Mode with User Preference | As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark mode, and have my preference saved so it persists across sessions. | A dark mode toggle switch is displayed in the navbar (left of the New Call Log button) showing a sun icon in light mode and moon icon in dark mode. Clicking the toggle switches between themes with smooth transitions. The user's preference is stored in the database using a `user_preferences` table with key-value storage. The preference is automatically loaded on every page via a Flask context processor. The dark mode uses Bootstrap 5's native `data-bs-theme` attribute along with custom CSS for cards, list items, and backgrounds to ensure proper contrast and readability. API endpoints (`GET /api/preference/<key>` and `POST /api/preference`) handle preference retrieval and storage. |
| **FR040**      | Customer View Toggle with Preference | As a user, I want to toggle between alphabetical and grouped customer views, and have my preference saved so it persists across sessions. | The customers list page has toggle buttons to switch between alphabetical and grouped views. The alphabetical view (`/customers`) shows all customers in a simple A-Z list with seller and territory badges, optimized for fast loading. The grouped view (`/customers/grouped`) organizes customers by their assigned seller with expandable groups. A "Grouped" button appears on the alphabetical view, and an "Alphabetical" button appears on the grouped view. Clicking either button saves the preference to the database via an API call (`/api/preferences/customer-view`) and navigates to the selected view. The `/customers` route checks the user's preference and redirects to the appropriate view automatically. The preference persists across sessions using the `user_preferences.customer_view_grouped` boolean column. |
| **FR041**      | Auto-Populate Seller in Call Log Form | As a user, when creating a call log, I want the seller field to be automatically populated from the customer and not independently changeable. | On the call log creation and edit forms, the seller field is automatically populated based on the selected customer and displayed as read-only (disabled). The field shows "(auto-populated from customer)" helper text to indicate its behavior. When the customer selection changes, the seller field updates automatically. The field uses a hidden input to submit the value since disabled fields don't submit. The read-only seller field has custom styling with reduced opacity and a not-allowed cursor. In light mode, it displays with a gray background (#e9ecef), and in dark mode with a dark background (#343a40) that matches the theme. This ensures data consistency by preventing users from assigning a seller different from the customer's assigned seller. |
| **FR042**      | Topic Sort Toggle with Preference | As a user, I want to toggle between alphabetical and call-count sorting for topics, and have my preference saved. | The topics list page has a toggle button to switch between alphabetical sorting (default) and sorting by number of calls (descending). The button label shows the alternative sort option: "By Calls" when in alphabetical mode, "Alphabetical" when in call-count mode. The icon changes between sort-alpha-down and sort-numeric-down. Clicking the button saves the preference to the database via `/api/preferences/topic-sort` and reloads the page to show the new sort order. The preference persists across sessions using the `user_preferences.topic_sort_by_calls` boolean column. Topics are eager-loaded with their call logs, and sorting is performed in Python for efficiency on small datasets. |
| **FR043**      | User Menu and Preferences Page | As a user, I want a centralized place to manage all my preferences instead of toggling them on individual pages. | The navbar header includes a user menu dropdown (person-circle icon) on the right side, next to the dark mode toggle. The dropdown contains: "Dark Mode" toggle, "Preferences" (active link to `/preferences`), "Data Management" (active link to `/data-management`), "User Profile" (disabled placeholder), and "Log Out" (disabled placeholder). The New Call Log button has been moved from the header to the top-right of the home page as a large primary button. The Preferences page (`/preferences`) displays all user preferences in organized cards: **Appearance** section with dark mode toggle switch, and **View Preferences** section with radio button groups for Customer View (Alphabetical/Grouped) and Topic Sort (Alphabetical/By Calls). All toggles save immediately via API calls with a temporary success message. Changes to dark mode update the UI immediately without page reload. The user menu button uses muted colors in dark mode (#495057 background) to reduce brightness and maintain visual hierarchy. |
| **FR044**      | Data Import/Export Management | As a user, I want to export my data for backup and import data to restore or migrate between instances. | The Data Management page (`/data-management`) accessible from the user menu provides comprehensive import/export functionality. **Export Section**: Download data as JSON (complete backup with all relationships, best for reimporting) or CSV (separate files in ZIP archive, best for analysis in Excel). Export statistics show counts of customers, sellers, territories, topics, and call logs. **Import Section**: Upload JSON files previously exported from NoteHelper. Options include skipping duplicate entries based on names/identifiers. Import results show counts of imported and skipped items by entity type. **Danger Zone**: Clear all data button with confirmation modal requiring typing "DELETE ALL DATA" to proceed. All operations use API endpoints under `/api/data-management/`. This enables easy backup, migration between NoteHelper instances, and recovery from data loss scenarios. |
| **FR045**      | Organizational Structure with PODs, Solution Engineers, and Verticals | As a user, I want to track the full sales and support structure including PODs, solution engineers, seller types, and customer verticals. | **PODs**: Every territory belongs to exactly one POD. A POD can have multiple territories. PODs are organizational groupings containing sellers and solution engineers. **Sellers**: Each seller has an `alias` (Microsoft email alias that becomes an email by appending @microsoft.com) and a `seller_type` (either "Acquisition" or "Growth"). Every customer's type is determined by their assigned seller's type. **Solution Engineers**: PODs have three solution engineer roles with specific specialties: "Azure Data", "Azure Core and Infra", and "Azure Apps and AI". Each role is optional (may be unassigned for some PODs). Solution engineers have a name, alias (Microsoft email), specialty, and POD assignment. They are the "Azure Technical Sellers" this application is designed for. **Verticals**: Customers are tagged with verticals using a many-to-many relationship (like topics). Verticals have two-level hierarchy: Vertical (e.g., "Financial Services") and Vertical Category (e.g., "Banking"). This allows reporting on customers in the same vertical or category. **Data Model**: Add `pods` table with name. Add `solution_engineers` table with name, alias, specialty enum, and POD foreign key. Add `verticals` table with name and category. Add `customers_verticals` many-to-many association table. Update `territories` table with POD foreign key. Update `sellers` table with alias and seller_type enum. Update `customers` table to support vertical many-to-many relationship. All new fields are optional except seller_type (defaults to "Growth" for validation). Forms and views updated to allow entry and display of these new organizational structures. |
| **FR046**      | Real-Time CSV Import Progress with Streaming | As a user, when importing alignment sheet CSV data, I want to see real-time progress updates showing which step is currently processing. | The Data Management import functionality uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream progress updates in real-time as the CSV is processed. The frontend displays progress messages showing: file upload, CSV encoding detection, territory processing, seller processing and associations, POD creation and associations, solution engineer processing (Data/Infra/Apps), vertical creation, and customer processing (with updates every 50 customers for large imports). The backend (`import_api.py`) contains a generator function that yields JSON-formatted progress messages at each processing step. The frontend JavaScript uses Fetch API with ReadableStream to consume the event stream and update the UI dynamically. On completion, a summary shows counts of PODs, territories, sellers, solution engineers, verticals, and customers created/skipped. This provides transparency into long-running imports (300+ customers) and helps users identify issues during processing. The import endpoint is at `POST /api/data-management/import` and accepts multipart form data with a CSV file. Statistics are displayed via `GET /api/data-management/stats` showing organizational structure (PODs, territories, sellers, solution engineers) and customer data (customers, verticals, topics, call logs). |
| **FR047**      | POD Management and Editing | As a user, I want to view, create, and edit PODs with their territories and solution engineers. | PODs can be viewed in a list showing POD names, territory counts, seller counts, and solution engineer counts. Each POD is clickable to view details. The POD detail page displays the POD name with all associated territories, sellers (derived from territories), and solution engineers. The POD edit page allows updating the POD name, selecting multiple territories via checkboxes (showing seller count for each), and selecting multiple solution engineers via checkboxes (showing email and specialty). The form uses scrollable containers with max-height for many territories/SEs. The POD view route uses `selectinload` for optimized eager loading of collections. PODs are displayed as primary blue badges throughout the UI (seller list, territory view). POD routes: `GET /pods` (list), `GET /pod/<id>` (view), `GET /pod/<id>/edit` (edit form), `POST /pod/<id>/edit` (update). |
| **FR048**      | Solution Engineer List View | As a user, I want to view all solution engineers with their PODs and specialties in one place. | A solution engineers list page (`/solution-engineers`) displays all SEs with their names, email aliases, specialties (Data/Core/Apps shown as info badge), and associated PODs (shown as primary badges). Each SE is clickable to view/edit details. An edit button is provided for quick access. The view is accessible from the main navigation as "SEs" between Sellers and Customers. The route uses `joinedload` to eagerly load POD relationships for efficient display. This provides a centralized view of all technical sellers and their organizational structure. |
| **FR049**      | Customer Form Centered Layout | As a user, I want the customer create/edit form to be centered on the page for better visual focus. | The customer form template uses Bootstrap's offset classes (`col-md-8 offset-md-2`) to center the 8-column-wide form with 2 columns of offset on each side. The page header is wrapped in the same container structure to maintain alignment with the form content. This creates a focused, centered layout that improves readability and reduces eye movement on wide screens. The form maintains full width on smaller screens (mobile). |
| **FR050**      | Show PODs in Seller List | As a user, I want to see which POD each seller belongs to when viewing the sellers list. | The sellers list displays POD badges for each seller. PODs are derived from the seller's territories using Jinja2 template filters to extract unique PODs. POD badges appear as primary blue badges with a diagram icon before the territory badges. The seller list route eagerly loads territories with their POD relationships (`db.joinedload(Seller.territories).joinedload(Territory.pod)`) for efficient display. This helps users quickly understand organizational structure and POD membership when browsing sellers. |
